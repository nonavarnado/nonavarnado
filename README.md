### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m a graduate of UC Irvineâ€™s School of Physical Science in the Earth System Science dept.  Before that I worked in nonprofit transportation advocacy, focused on geospatial data for decision making.

My primary research interest is in machine learning for atmospheric science. At UCI I participated in the Guenther Lab / 
<a href="https://bai.ess.uci.edu/">Biosphere Atmosphere Interactions (BAI) group</a>
 devoted to BVOC chemistry in modeling and field research.  I focused on gaining an understanding of edge issues in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/117nnUMp_9kV3IbfEMjx2cawn__c-G_U3b4yKWfwtM7g/edit?usp=sharing"> aerosol physics</a> as they relate to Global Climate Models and atmospheric chemistry (AerChemMIP) modelling and on projections of increased BVOC emissions due to climate change in combination with future reductions in anthropogenic emissions.
